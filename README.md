> I've always been a science guy, always impressed and frightened at the same time on how technologies in diverse field would expand so fast. As a teenager, i would run up to my mom telling her about the last news i'd have heard about. I'm curious and i like to share that curiosity. The more you learn and grow, the more you can share that knowledge around you and make your close environment intellectually richer. In my opinion, you can only rise properly and with great human values listening to others experiences and advices. I've failed, i've won, i've grown thanks to experiences i've solved on myself and shared with people who've been around me.
Now let's do our best not to fail, and grow together working on all the upcoming challenges üëç

> As a result of an education that i praise and thank my entourage for, i humbly try to make things better as a human. I tend to join and encourage businesses trying their best to reduce inequalities, that give a chance to everyone to perform and to show what they are capable of. As a developper, and as a man supportive of feminist movement, i enjoy seeing more and more women joining IT studies and would like to see more compagnies and fellow developpers carrying women interest on IT jobs.
> My go-to compagny is a compagny that suit my values and which will not win over my humanity.

> I did not start to code when i was 7yo, believe it or not. I've always had a look on how could work a program, like games i used to play as a teenager. I remember being introduced by my father to coding when i was a kid. He would show me how great was the game he just made. It was a little achievement, but he was proud of it, and that's all that mattered i guess.
In high school, i decided that i would go after Computer Sciences studies. I loved Sciences, and i desired the most a domain where i could be creative, where i could learn most by myself, with the help of others, and not the other way around. If you plan to go to computer sciences because "i'll get a job 100%", trust me, you're the wrong way. You'll need to have, or build passion.
   That was my new challenge, and  here we are. I'm mainly into back-end dev for now. Might change, but i feel better close to datas  üòÅ
